## **`OPTIONS`** request and response might look when implementing **WebDAV Core only**:


### **OPTIONS Request**
```http
OPTIONS /webdav/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/10.0.19041
```

### **OPTIONS Response**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Allow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, COPY, MOVE, MKCOL, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH
DAV: 1,2
MS-Author-Via: DAV
Content-Length: 0
```

### Explanation:

| Header         | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Allow`        | Lists supported HTTP methods (WebDAV + standard ones like `GET`, `PUT`) |
| `DAV: 1,2`     | Indicates support for **WebDAV level 1 and 2** (2 includes locking)      |
| `MS-Author-Via`| Used by Microsoft clients to detect DAV support                          |

- `DAV: 1` means **basic WebDAV** (properties, collections, etc.).
- `DAV: 2` adds **locking support**—you can **omit `2`** if you're not implementing `LOCK`/`UNLOCK`.

### Minimal Response for Core-Only (No Locking)
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Allow: OPTIONS, GET, PUT, DELETE, MKCOL, COPY, MOVE, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH
DAV: 1
Content-Length: 0
```

This will work for many WebDAV clients, but **Windows clients may expect locking (`DAV: 2`)** and could have trouble if it’s missing.

Would you like a code example of how to return this response using a minimal web framework (like ASP.NET Minimal API, Express.js, or Python Flask)?
