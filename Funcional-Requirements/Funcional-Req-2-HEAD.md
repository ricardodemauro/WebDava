Sure! The **`HEAD`** operation in HTTP (and WebDAV) is used to retrieve the **headers** of a resource **without the body**. Itâ€™s typically used by clients to check things like:

- If a resource exists
- When it was last modified
- Its size
- ETag or other metadata

---

### **HEAD Request Example**
```http
HEAD /webdav/documents/report.pdf HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/10.0.19041
```

---

### **HEAD Response Example**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/pdf
Content-Length: 84321
Last-Modified: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:34:00 GMT
ETag: "a7b9c1d3e5f6"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
```

### Explanation of Headers:

| Header            | Description                                          |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `Content-Type`    | MIME type of the file                                |
| `Content-Length`  | File size in bytes                                   |
| `Last-Modified`   | Last modification date/time                          |
| `ETag`            | Unique identifier for the version of the file        |
| `Accept-Ranges`   | Indicates support for partial content (e.g., downloads) |

**Note:**  
Even though `Content-Length` and others are included, the **body is never sent** in a `HEAD` response.

### Implementation Note:
If you're implementing WebDAV, you can usually **reuse the same logic as `GET`** but skip writing the body to the response.

Would you like to see a simple code snippet in C# or Node.js to handle this?
