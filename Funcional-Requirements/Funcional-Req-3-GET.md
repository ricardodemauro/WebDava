Absolutely! The **`GET`** operation in WebDAV (same as in standard HTTP) is used to **retrieve the contents** of a file.

---

### **GET Request Example**
```http
GET /webdav/documents/report.pdf HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/10.0.19041
```

---

### **GET Response Example**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/pdf
Content-Length: 84321
Last-Modified: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:34:00 GMT
ETag: "a7b9c1d3e5f6"
Accept-Ranges: bytes

%PDF-1.4
%...
(binary content of the PDF file follows)
```

### Explanation:

| Header           | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Content-Type`   | MIME type of the file (`application/pdf` in this case)       |
| `Content-Length` | File size in bytes                                           |
| `Last-Modified`  | Last modified time of the file                               |
| `ETag`           | Unique file version ID (helps with caching/versioning)       |
| `Accept-Ranges`  | Indicates support for partial downloads                      |
| **Body**         | The actual binary content of the file (not shown here)       |

---

### Behavior Notes:
- A `GET` request to a **file** should return its binary content.
- A `GET` request to a **folder** should return **403 Forbidden** or a redirect—folders are typically accessed using `PROPFIND`, not `GET`.

---

### Optional Enhancements:
- You can support **range requests** (`Range: bytes=...`) to allow resumable downloads.
- If the client sends `If-None-Match` with an ETag, you can return `304 Not Modified` if it matches—useful for caching.
