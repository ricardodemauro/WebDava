# WebDava Project

## Overview
WebDava is a WebDAV server implementation designed to handle various WebDAV operations such as `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`, `GET`, `PROPFIND`, `MKCOL`, `PUT`, `LOCK`, `DELETE`, and `PROPPATCH`. This project aims to provide a robust and extensible WebDAV server for managing resources efficiently.

## Accomplishments
- **Core WebDAV Operations**: Implemented handlers for all major WebDAV operations.
- **XML Validation**: Integrated XML validation using an embedded `webdav.xsd` schema.
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized the project into handlers, helpers, repositories, and entities for maintainability.
- **Coding Standards**: Followed modern C# coding practices and architectural guidelines.

## Missing Features
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Currently, there is no mechanism for user authentication or access control.
- **Advanced Locking Mechanisms**: Basic locking is implemented, but advanced scenarios like shared locks need to be addressed.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for edge cases and unexpected scenarios.
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests are missing for critical components.

## Technologies Used
- **C#**: The primary programming language.
- **ASP.NET Core**: For building the WebDAV server.
- **XML Schema (XSD)**: For validating XML requests.
- **Serilog**: For logging and diagnostics.

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from the community! Here are some ways you can help:
- Implement missing features listed above.
- Write unit tests to improve code coverage.
- Optimize performance for large file operations.
- Report bugs or suggest enhancements.

To contribute, fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Please ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards.

## Credits
This project was developed by Ricardo. Special thanks to all contributors who help improve this project.

## Next Steps
- Add support for user authentication and authorization.
- Implement shared locking mechanisms.
- Enhance the documentation with usage examples and API details.
- Deploy the server to a cloud environment for public testing.
